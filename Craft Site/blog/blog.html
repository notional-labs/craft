                        <h6>
                            Welcome to Craft Economy, a minecraft server leveraging the advantages of blockchain, DAO’s, tokens, NFT’s and more. This post intends to highlight the ecosystem at a high level, and give players an overview of what to expect come launch. <br/>
                        </h6>
                        <h4>Cosmos:</h4>
                        <h6>
                            Craft Economy is a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and is governed by its stakeholders. One of the many reasons we chose to build on the cosmos-sdk is the strong governance system that they already support. This allows users to make proposals to other members of the ecosystem. <br/>
                        </h6>
                        <h4>Tokens:</h4>
                        <h6>
                            In the Craft Economy, there are two tokens with individual purposes. The first token, CRAFT, serves as the in-game currency for transactions (including NFT’s), and is traded on secondary markets. CRAFT is inflationary, but not through the standard staking model (more to come on this point). The CRAFT token has a maximum supply of 250,000,000 tokens. The second token, EXP, serves as the experience metric that gamers are already used to. EXP is not tradeable, fungible, transferrable-- and therefore not purchasable. The only way to get EXP is to earn it, through various tasks and contributions to the game (includes but is not limited to, completing quests, voting in governance, buying NFT’s, etc.). The EXP token has no supply cap, and is minted and distributed daily. EXP is the governance token, and also the yield bearing token. This means that users will vote in proportion to their EXP, not their CRAFT, and they will earn CRAFT based on their ownership of EXP. <br/>
                        </h6>
                        <h4>NFT’s:</h4>
                        <h6>
                            At the core of Craft Economy are NFT’s for an array of in-game items such as land, skins, artwork, and more. Representing ownership of land as NFT’s is an obvious concept, and allows individuals to freely trade their land to each other, or hold the land for the yield it can generate (whether it’s a farm, mining operation, or a residence). Additionally skins and artwork create an opportunity for players to create and issue their own NFT collections within the game (this also includes existing NFT communities). <br/>
                        </h6>
                        <h6>
                            Tl;dr, the Craft Economy returns the value back to gamers, and allows them to capture real-world monetary value from their time spent in game. It pays to play, and we are excited to have you join us. <br/>
